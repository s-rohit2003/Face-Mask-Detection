Abstract:

This paper discusses the use of computer vision and machine learning for automated face mask detection. It covers the technology, its applications in public health, model selection, challenges, ethical considerations, and future directions. Face mask detection systems play a vital role in enforcing mask-wearing mandates and reducing disease transmission.
